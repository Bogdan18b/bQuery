# bQuery

A lightweight vanilla javaScript library for manipulating DOM elements, inspired by jQuery; Includes a Todo List app implemented using the library. You can see the Todo List app [here](http://bogdanbobletec.us/bQuery/index.html). If you want to test the library, you can open the console and use $b to add/remove features.
